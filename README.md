    {

Ideas on stuff to research:
 - Use burpsuite to copy the cookies ‚úÖ
	- Works even from a different country and different IP
 - What cookies are necessary to read mails‚ùì 
 - What if the `User-Agent` is different ‚úÖ
    - On `Computer 1` the `User-Agent` is:
        ```
        Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.15; rv:102.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/102.0
        ```
    - On `Computer 2` the `User-Agent` is:
        ```
        Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:102.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/102.0
        ```
        I also tried using chromium:
        ```
        Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/103.0.5060.53 Safari/537.36
        ```
     - Still works, so the user agent doesn't really matter
 - What if the time is different ‚úÖ 
    - The time on `Computer 1` is:
        ```
        12:09
        Timezone: Israel Daylight Time
        ```
    - The time on `Computer 2` is:
        ```
        9:09
        Timezone: Central European Summer Time
        ```
    - Still works, so the timezone doesn't really matter
 - Try to use the same headers ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
    - This doesn't matter, as it works even without using the same headers
 - Are notifications sent ‚ùå
    - I didn't get any notification to my phone, or to my main Gmail window
```
ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è = Doesn't matter anymore
‚úÖ = Checked, and succefully worked
‚ùå = Checks, and is not correct
‚ùì = Still didn't check or go through
```

I used burp on my machine, and surfed to `https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox`:
